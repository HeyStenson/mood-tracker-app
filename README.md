Moment.js <br>
MongoDB <br>

The only page taking advantage of EJS is the user history page. I had intended to move all of the header information into EJS partials as well, but ran out of time to do so. <br>

While I found Moment.js to be a great tool, I wasn't able to work out a way to implement it in the EJS template that renders the user moods. I am going to continue working on this and in v.2 will be adding a CSS hide/show that shows the date that the mood was added on mouseover.
